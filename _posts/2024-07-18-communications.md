Looking backwards, things we did previously often look awkward or shameful. My communication skills weren’t that different.

Contributing to open source has changed my life in many aspects: added friends, jobs, titles and opportunities, but the main contribution open source is yielding me nowadays is: the necessity and improvement of my communication.

When I started [talkd.ai](http://talkd.ai) with [Avelino](https://avelino.run/about/) last year, we were just two friends talking on a WhatsApp chat that would go silent for days/weeks without any update from both of our sides.

After getting to the GitHub Accelerator, we've started to gain some traction and one of the first things I've noticed is that I didn’t communicate clearly what the project did.

~~Honestly, looking back, I lacked focus - but this is another text coming soon.~~

After reflecting for a while, I think I have some conclusions about communication (mainly async):

- It’s better to over communicate than to not

- People are in a different time/space/headspace/setting, communicate everything crystal clear so everyone can understand

- Communication is a super power, and in the world nowadays, it's lacking a lot - it can bring people together, bridge ideas and shape movements and it can also end friendships, make ideas and movements die - choose wisely how you communicate!

Coming to a conclusion: communicate… do it as often and as possible, of course sense if its needed, but don’t hesitate to do that
